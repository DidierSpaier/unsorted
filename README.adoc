[[checkfb.c]]checkfb.c::
+
This program tests the usability of a linux frame buffer and indicates the screen size in pixels and the density in bits per pixel.
+
It comes handy for instance to programmatically adapt a font size (argument of the -s option) in a `fbterm` command to a given screen, so
that the size of a displayed text on this screen fills the screen while respecting a minimum number of rows and columns.
+
This allows for instance to maximise the font size while respecting the text's layout to help readers with a low vision.
+
Compile it for instance with this command:
+
----
gcc checkfb.c -o checkfb
